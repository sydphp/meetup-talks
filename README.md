# SydPHP

This is the official repo of the [SydPHP meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/SydPHP/).

## Usage

Via using this repo you can do the following:

### Propose new topics

Have a specific problem in mind that you would like to know how to solve? Is there something that you always wanted to learn but didn't find properly composed materials wo working prototypes on the Internet? Look no further! Simply create an issue with a title and a comment, and if the community finds the topic interesting, we will put it on the roadmap.

### Vote on existing topics

Simply reacting with a :+1: on the issue's original comment is sufficient. It is not recommended to keep adding :+1: standalone comments because it makes the vote counting slightly more difficult.

### Volunteer as a speaker

Do you want to practice your speaking skills, or do you think that you would be able to fill the knowledge gap of a proposed topic? If so, please don't hesitate to create a pull request with a brief description/bulletpoint list of what you would talk about, and we will get back to you as soon as we can!
